# crows
We're trying to use NLP techniques to interact with crows.
We're just getting started. This a placeholder for future work and ease of sharing. Simple code exist for playing sounds from the command line, but there is not enough for a commit yet. Planning on primarily using python.

Our drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1pkgcZ9Zf4qaU9CMWZPLW11bWc?usp=sharing folder contains our most current working developments and poster for the PSU Student Research Symposium.
